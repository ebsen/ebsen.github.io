			<p class="h4 italic grey-700">With The Force Awakens arriving on iTunes and video earlier this month and the trailer for this year&#39;s Rogue One dropping this week, I thought this made as good a time as any to dust off and finish a post I started around the time that The Force Awakens hit theaters in the US.</p>

<p>Like everyone else in the universe, I saw <em>The Force Awakens</em> over the holidays. The day after, I introduced my son (age six) to <em>Episode I: The Phantom Menace</em>.</p>

<p><strong>He loved it.</strong></p>

<p>Not only that, he loved most of all the parts that cause me and so much of the rest of the Internet to groan and sigh and wail: the perpetual, gratuitous fish-eating-fish in the center of the Naboo; that a boy (hardly older than him) might fly a ship into space and knock out an entire starship by accident; and, yes, Jar Jar Binks.</p>

<p>Actually, he loved all the accidents. He really enjoys physical comedy and, truthfully, The Phantom Menace deals that out in spades. He laughed at every clumsy droid antic. Jar Jar&rsquo;s stupid stunts though really made him roll. The kid was jumping up and down in glee over all the things that make me cringe.</p>

<p>Since he really doesn&rsquo;t follow dialogue, he completely missed everything about midi-chloridians. He missed a lot of things, really. He still absolutely loved it.</p>

<p>I have heard George Lucas defend the movies in general (and Jar Jar in particular) as &ldquo;Well, kids enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That my son loved this movie didn&rsquo;t really surprise me. What did surprise me was how much more <em>I</em> enjoyed the film watching it with him. Sure, he asked a thousand questions, sometimes all at once. The dialogue mostly bored him. (On that, we agree.) Still, seeing him genuinely crack up so hard over all the cheesy stuff caused me to lighten up a little about the while thing.</p>

<p>That night, he brought his toy light saber to bed with him.</p>

			<p class="h4 italic grey-700">Finally getting around to moving over the projects from my old portfolio site</p>
			<p>Before relaunching it as what it is now, this site served as a portfolio of personal and professional projects. Today, I finally got around to porting (most) of those projects over to this site.</p>

<p>Some of my personal favorites include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/project/graduation-2015">Graduation 2015</a></li>
<li><a href="/project/hobo-day-parade">Hobo Day Parade</a></li>
<li><a href="/project/news-center">News Center</a></li>
<li><a href="/project/songbook">Songbook</a></li>
</ul>

<!-- In addition to that, I finally corrected my long-standing error of not keeping this site under version control. While I struggle with how to represent everything that ebsen.me has contained, that's no reason not to track it _somehow_. -->

<!-- I had been dragging my feet on this because I couldn't decide between trying to self-host this site on a Raspberry Pi or just running it off GitHub Pages. Since my Pi just arrived yesterday, I'll need to play around with it for awhile before I make that decision. -->

<p>Check out the <a href="/project">projects</a> page for all the details.</p>

			<p>A custom-themed WordPress site built from Photoshop designs. It features a prominent carousel on the homepage and several post types to display information in various places across the site.</p>

<p>I led a team of myself and two student developers to prototype these designs into code. I chose <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> as the front-end framework and <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> to compile it. These technologies helped us built the site responsively, allowing it to work across difference screen sizes. We then converted the resulting code to work with WordPress.</p>

<p>This was our first project using responsive design and the above technologies. Today, every project we start is responsive, we have several sites running on WordPress, and we use Node with nearly every website we have.</p>
